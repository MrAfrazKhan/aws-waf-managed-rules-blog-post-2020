## Defense In Depth using AWS Managed Rules - Blog Post

This repo holds supporting documentation for the AWS Security Blog post deploying a multi-layered Web ACL on AWS WAF using AWS CloudFormation templates. This helps customers get started with AWS Managed Rules and implement their security enforcement based on the same development best practices they are used to.

These AWS CloudFormation does not create the required Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancers. They are only for creating Web ACL's for these resources while using AWS Managed Rules in doing so.

You will find that there are four CloudFormation templates.
